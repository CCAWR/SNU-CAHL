# SNU-CAHL

Seoul National University - Climate Change Impact Assessment for Hydrology Library (SNU-CAHL) is a collection of tools for climate change impact assessment in hydrology.  The tool has three main goals:

* Automation of hydrologic modelling in climate change scenarios.

* Easily import and integrate climate data with hydrology data for multi-model analysis.

* Provide the resources for informed decisions and conclusions through performance indexes.

This tool was made by the Research Group for [Climate Change Adaptation in Water Resources](http://ccawr.snu.ac.kr) at Seoul National University.

## Installation

`snucahl` package requires the [hydromad package](http://hydromad.catchment.org/), which is a required dependency but is not available on CRAN.  Install `hydromad` with the following commands:

```
install.packages(c("zoo", "latticeExtra", "polynom", "car", "Hmisc","reshape"))
install.packages("hydromad", repos = "http://hydromad.catchment.org")
```

`snucahl` can be installed and loaded using the following commands:

```
library("hydromad")
some function to install snucahl
library("snucahl")
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
